        <li>2 1/4 cups crushed pretzels</li>

        <li>3/4 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>16 ounces whipped topping</li>
        <li>1 (5.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups cold milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped peanut butter cups and coated peanut butter candies, such as Reese's PiecesÂ®, or as needed for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until fragrant, about 10 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese, peanut butter, confectioner's sugar and vanilla together with an electric mixer until well blended, light and fluffy. Fold in 2 1/2 cups whipped topping.</li>
        <li>Spread peanut butter mixture evenly over cooled crust. </li>
        <li>Whisk together chocolate pudding mix and milk until smooth, well combined and slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Carefully spread chocolate pudding mixture over peanut butter layer, taking care not to mix layers together. Top with remaining whipped topping.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with chopped candies and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.</li>
    </ol>
